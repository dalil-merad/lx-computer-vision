# Learning Experience (LX): Computer Vision

Find the most up-to-date instructions on [how to run LXs on the Duckietown manual](https://docs.duckietown.com/ente/duckietown-manual/60-learning-experiences/lx-setup-pid-control.html). 

**NOTE:** All commands below are intended to be executed from the root directory of this exercise (i.e., the directory containing this `README`).

## 1. Make sure your exercise is up-to-date

Update your exercise definition and instructions,

    git pull upstream ente

**NOTE:** to pull from upstream, you need to have completed the instructions in the [duckietown-lx repository README](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-lx/blob/mooc2022/README.md) to *fork* this repository.


## 2. Make sure your system is up-to-date

- 💻 Always make sure your Duckietown Shell is updated to the latest version. See [installation instructions](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-shell)

This exercise is meant to be run with the `ente` version of the shell commands. You can switch to that version with `dts profile switch ente`. 

- 💻 Update the shell commands: `dts update`

- 💻 Update your laptop/desktop: `dts desktop update`

- 🚙 Update your Duckiebot: `dts duckiebot update ROBOTNAME` (where `ROBOTNAME` is the name of your (real or virtual - more on this later) Duckiebot chosen during the initialization procedure.)

## 3. Work on the exercise


### Launch the code editor

Open the code editor by running the following command,

```
dts code editor
```

Wait for a URL to appear on the terminal, then click on it or copy-paste it in the address bar
of your browser to access the code editor. The first thing you will see in the code editor is
this same document, you can continue there.


### Walkthrough of notebooks

**NOTE**: You should be reading this from inside the code editor in your browser.

Inside the code editor, use the navigator sidebar on the left-hand side to navigate to the
`notebooks` directory and open the first notebook.

Follow the instructions on the notebook and work through the notebooks in sequence.


### Building your code

You can build your code with 

```
dts code build -R ROBOT_NAME
```

This will build a docker image with your code compiled inside - you should your ROS node get built during the process. 


### Testing with Duckiematrix

In order to test your code in the Duckiematrix you will need a virtual robot. You can create one with the command:

```
dts duckiebot virtual create --type duckiebot --configuration DB21J [VBOT]
```

where `[VBOT]` is the hostname. It can be anything you like, with [some constraints](https://docs.duckietown.com/ente/duckietown-manual/10-setup/03-duckiebot/flashing-sd-card-duckiebot-initialization-complete.html). Make sure to remember your robot (host)name for later.

Then you can start your virtual robot with the command:

```
dts duckiebot virtual start [VIRTUAL_ROBOT_NAME]
```

You should see it with a status `Booting` and finally `Ready` if you look at `dts fleet discover`: 

```
     | Hardware |   Type    | Model |  Status  | Hostname 
---  | -------- | --------- | ----- | -------- | ---------
vbot |  virtual | duckiebot | DB21J |  Ready   | vbot.local
```

Now that your virtual robot is ready you can start the Duckiematrix. From this exercise directory do:

```
dts code start_matrix

```

You should see the Unity-based Duckiematrix simulator start up. 


### 💻 Testing 


To test your code in the duckiematrix you can do:

```
dts code workbench -m -R [VBOT]
```

and to test your code on your real Duckiebot you can do:

```
dts code workbench -R [ROBOT_NAME]
```


In another terminal, you can launch the `noVNC` viewer for this exercise:

```
dts code vnc -R [ROBOT_NAME]
```

where `[ROBOT_NAME]` could be the real or the virtual robot (use whichever you ran the `dts code workbench` and `dts code build` command with).

In the noVNC desktop, click on the icon marked "VLS - Visual Lane Servoing Exercise" and then you should follow the prompts
in the terminal where you ran `dts code workbench`.

Now you can proceed to the [first notebook](./notebooks/01-Pinhole-Camera/pinhole_camera_matrix.ipynb).
